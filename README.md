# Frequently Asked Questions 

This repository is meant to be a place where users can raise questions or concerns about HPC related issues.

> :warning:  _FAQ presented in the GitHub are abridged copies of tickets received by the Research Computing team. Their phrasing is kept, but usernames and paths are adjusted to say "&lt;USER&gt;" and "&lt;DIR&gt;" to obscure the submitting user's identity. Similar replacements were made throughout._
