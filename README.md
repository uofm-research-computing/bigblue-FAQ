# Frequently Asked Questions 

This repository is meant to be a place where users can raise questions or concerns about HPC related issues.

Please visit the Issues tab to see all the FAQ tickets.

> :warning:  _FAQ presented in the GitHub are abridged copies of tickets received by the Research Computing team. Their phrasing is kept, but usernames and paths are adjusted to say "&lt;USER&gt;" and "&lt;DIR&gt;" to obscure the submitting user's identity. Similar replacements were made throughout._

## Hierarchy of Inquiry

If you have questions or concerns with the HPC, we ask that you address the following resources first.

1. Visit [Research Computing](https://uofmwiki.memphis.edu/shelves/research-computing) on the official UofM Wiki page. Note that you will have to sign in with and authenticate your UofM account. There you will find a record of guides for operating on the HPC including

    - GPU Jobs
    - Installing Software

2. Review this GitHub repo to view previous issues reported by other users. Visit the [Issues](https://github.com/uofm-research-computing/bigblue-FAQ/issues) tab above to browse previous tickets. 
    - HPC Admins are responsible for adding tickets filed with the University's TopDesk system here after completion, but will accept issues files here without need of going through TopDesk.
3. If your question/concern is left unaddressed, feel free to email the HPC admins (hpc-admins@memphis.edu)
